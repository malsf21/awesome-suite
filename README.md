**Awesome Suite is currently on hold as Matt pursues his other dreams. Maybe he'll revisit this someday.**

## What is the Awesome Suite?
The Awesome Suite, to be honest, is just me learning how to use electron and putting into action some really weird ideas. It's not meant to be serious, just lots of love and fun!

## What's in the Awesome Suite right now?
Right now, it's the DJ Khaled Button, four Math functions, a DNA Manipulator, Pong and the Settings Pane.

## What's in store for the Awesome Suite?
I'm looking to add a bunch more math functions (such as a Pi Generator, Quadratic solver, list of all prime/all factors, etc.), a DNA reverse/complement/reverse-complementer, a game, and more DJ Khaled stuff. Major key to success.
