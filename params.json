{"name":"Awesome Suite","tagline":"A collection of fun tools","body":"# The Awesome Suite\r\n### By Matthew Wang\r\n\r\n## What is the Awesome Suite?\r\nThe Awesome Suite, to be honest, is just me learning how to use electron and putting into action some really weird ideas. It's not meant to be serious, just lots of love and fun!\r\n\r\n## What's in the Awesome Suite right now?\r\nRight now, it's the DJ Khaled Button, three Math functions, Pong and the Settings Pane.\r\n\r\n## What's in store for the Awesome Suite?\r\nI'm looking to add a bunch more math functions (such as a Pi Generator, Quadratic solver, list of all prime/all factors, etc.), a DNA reverse/complement/reverse-complementer, a game, and more DJ Khaled stuff. Major key to success.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
